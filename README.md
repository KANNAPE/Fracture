# Fracture
### A personal project by Thomas Berger.

#### What is Fracture ?

Fracture is a personal project I'm developping, greatly inspired by Anthem and based on the feeling of flying like Iron Man. It's a multiplayer FPS game, where you can fly with your suit, an elytra.

#### How do I play Fracture ?

For now, the game is nearly prototyped, but you can walk around and press F to switch to the flying mode. In the future, the transition will be smooth and won't require two different objects in the level.

#### What is coming next ?

I'm going to work on this project until June, its due date. Until then, you can expect several additions, all coming through upcoming patches :
- Smooth transition between Ground mode and Fly mode (through a custom character movement component)
- Replication, inside a lobby you will be able to invite up to 3 friends!
- Some more work around the environment
